- [Microsoft Dynamics NAV Overview](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/18248.microsoft-dynamics-nav-overview.aspx)
- [Blast from the Past: Navision 3.56](https://www.hougaard.com/blast-from-the-past-navision-3-56/) The first episode is all about Navision 3.56. This is the grandfather of Business Central, and many of the things we take granted today originated in 3.56 back in 1990.
